# My Own Version of the Rock Your Body TikTok Trend

This is a simple Python project that plays around with the **Rock Your Body TikTok trend** in my own way.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yousri25/My-own-version-of-the-Rock-Your-Body-tiktok-trend.git
````

2. **Navigate into the project folder**

   ```bash
   cd My-own-version-of-the-Rock-Your-Body-tiktok-trend
   ```

3. **Run the Python script**

   ```bash
   python lyrics.py
   ```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

* Make sure you have **Python 3** installed on your system.
* No extra dependencies are required â€” just run and enjoy!

If you want, I can also make it **even cleaner and more GitHub-friendly** with badges and emphasis on Python. Do you want me to do that?
